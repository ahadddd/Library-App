Library
Make a form to store books. We need to store following information for each book:
ID (number),
Title,
Author,
Category,
Tags,
Status

Status can be 0 or 1, 
0 = book not available
1 = book is available

Make a table to display list of all books. On top of table display a dropdown called "Status"
This dropdown will be use to filter out books displayed in table. Like if user selects
"Available books Only" then table will show only available books.
The Status drop will have three options:
 - All books
 - Show available books
 - Show unavailable books

Create another form called "Book Issuance". This fill will be used to issue any book to some
user and hence updating the status of book as unavailable. This form will have following fields:
    Book ID, User name, Issue Date

Book ID will be a dropdown, which will display Book Title as text and book ID will
be used as value e.g. 
<option [value]="book.id">{{ book.title }}</option

Make  another table to display list of all users along with books they have issued from library.
